    "My first app was a simple punchclock that I still use to log my hours while working from home. It is a C# WinForms App and uses the .NET Framework. The practical experience of programming this app helped solidify my understanding of OOP and N-tier architecture, and gave me the great satisfaction of solving my own needs through software. I will get it featured here soon, but for now you can check it out on my Github.",
